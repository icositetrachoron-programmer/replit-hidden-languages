# Hidden languages on repl.it
One of the advantages on repl.it is that it has a massive variety of languages. There are more than you can see on the `New Repl` menu. 
Here is a list:

* [OCaml](https://repl.it/languages/ocaml)
* [Quil](https://repl.it/languages/quil)
* [SQLite](https://repl.it/languages/sqlite)
* [WebAssembly Text Format](https://repl.it/languages/wasm)
* [Babel ES6 Browser JavaScript](https://repl.it/languages/babel)

You can see a large list of languages, hidden or not [here](https://repl.it/talk/share/p-in-Reason/42012).
There may be more languages but I am yet to program a scraper to find them.
